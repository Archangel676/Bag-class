## C++ array-based, templated Bag class

# Assignment

Implement a bag data structure that can hold a collection of items. Items have no ordering within a bag, but it is possible to add, remove and count the items in a bag.

Make a dynamic array-based, templated Bag class. The class must do its own memory management; you may not use std::vector or any other library code to handle storage for your class.

# Goal

Ability to create classes implemented with dynamic arrays and templated over a value type "T".

## Attribution

The boilerplate starter code (Makefile, .vscode, .clang-format, and .gitignore) are from the VSCodeTemplates repository templates.
